# Flashcard
I myself love to learn new languages and not only that, but also learn anything.
So in order to do that, I've learned a new method of memorizing things and it is based on flashcards or simple notes that we describe the thing we are learning and then save it for reading again the same description later on.
And that gave me the idea of implementing a new Website based on this service for everyone.
